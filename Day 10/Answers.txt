1. B. 35%

2. D

3. C. 80

5.
vowellist = ['a','e','i','o','u','A','E','I','O','U']
word = input()
vowelno = 0
consonantno = 0
for char in word:
    if char in vowellist:
        vowelno += 1
    else:
        consonantno += 1

print(f'The word has {vowelno} of vowels and {consonantno} of consonants')


6. Two strings will be Anagrams of each other if they have same letters. So we check the letters and their repeatitions in the two strings. The code is given by:

word1 = input()
dict1 = {}
for char in word1:
    count = word1.count(char)
    dict1[char] = count

print(dict1)

word2 = input()
dict2 = {}
for char in word2:
    count = word2.count(char)
    dict2[char] = count

print(dict2)

if dict1 == dict2:
    print('Two Strings Are Anagrams of Each Other')
else:
    print('Two Strings Are Not Anagrams of Each Other')
